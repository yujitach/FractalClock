(Clicking/tapping the image brings you to YouTube.)

This is a slight modification of the nice screen saver 
http://www.dqd.com/~mayoff/programs/FractalClock/ which unfortunately no longer works on modern Macs.



It can be downloaded from the release tab. By default it runs as an independent app. 

If you prefer, you can install it as a screen saver from the menu "Fractal Clock â†’ Install screen saver...".
You will then be prompted to go to System Preferences, etc. 
(The code-signing of screen savers are tricky and difficult in recent macOS versions, so I am not sure if it can correctly run as a screen saver.)
