        <h1>Fractal Clock Screen Saver</h1>

	<p> By Rob Mayoff.</p>

	<p> This is a MacOS X screen saver.  It should work on MacOS X
	10.4 (Tiger) and later. </p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<div style='float:right'><a href='FractalClock.dmg'><img
	src='saver.png' width='109' height='70'
	alt='FractalClock disk image'></a></div>

        <p> Download <a href='FractalClock.dmg'>the screen saver disk
        image</a>. Find the file shown at right in your download list or
        download folder. Double-click it. </p>

	<h3 style='clear:both;padding-top:2em'>More Help</h3>

	<p> If you're using Firefox, you have to mount the disk image
	yourself.  Safari will automatically unpack it.  If you have
	trouble finding the file, check your browser's download list
	(Window > Downloads from Safari's menu bar; Tools > Downloads
	from Firefox's). <p>

	<p> Once System Preferences has installed the screen saver, you
	can move the copy in your downloads folder to the Trash. </p>

	<h2 style='clear:both'>Design Notes</h2>

	<p> <a href='FractalClock-source.dmg'>The source code.</a>  I
	have donated it to the public domain.

	<p> The screen saver runs at six times normal speed in the
	preview window.  When running full screen, it displays your
	local time. </p>

	<p> The idea was inspired by <a
	href='http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TreeBender/'
	>a Mathematica toy</a>.  You can read more about the toy <a
	href='http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/why_spend_more_than_five.html'
	>here</a>. </p>

	<p> My algorithm is a little different than Theodore Gray's.  Aside
	from the obvious difference that I move the locators
	automatically, I also allow the locators to be at any angle
	relative to the "trunk" of the tree (which is the hour hand in
	the screen saver).  In Theodore's version, the locators cannot
	go below the top of the trunk.  This change makes many more
	interesting patterns possible. </p>

        <p> The screen saver automatically adjusts its level of detail
        based on the speed and screen size of your Macintosh. Faster
        Macs and bigger screens will produce more detail. </p>

	<h2>Version History</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li> 2007/05/21: Version 1.0.
        <li> 2007/05/22: Version 1.0.1.  Fix a crash that happens when running as an actual screen saver, not in test mode in System Preferences.  I never actually tried that...
        <li> 2009/09/07: Version 1.1.  Added Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) compatibility.  This version should work on Intel and PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 also.  I also tweaked the colors and scaling.
